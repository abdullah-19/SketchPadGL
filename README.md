<h2>Simple Sketchpad</h2><br>
Simple sketchpad is an ancestor of modern graphics painting programs(e.g. Paint). The program enables an user to draw primitives, change line widths and colors, resize a window and exit the program. All of user's actions is kept as persistent data structure. There are some additional functionalities: interactive drawing(rubber banding), picking/dragging verices, highlighting vertices and pulsating effect. The program is implemented in C and OpenGL


<h3>Program execution</h3>
The program was developed for Mac Os X platform. It should work for any other platform after small changes in MakeFile. To run the program you need to go invoke the following command:

<b>make && ./sketchpad</b>

<h3>User interface</h3>
You may control the program by keyboard shortcuts and a pop-up menu. The latter is visible when right mouse button is depressed. All keyboard shortcuts may be read from the pop-up menu.
